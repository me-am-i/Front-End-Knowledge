### What is the difference between ShadowDOM and VirtualDOM?

<details>
<summary>View answer</summary>

> The Shadow DOM is a browser technology designed primarily for scoping variables and CSS in web components. The virtual DOM is a concept implemented by libraries in JavaScript on top of browser APIs.

</details>

### Which is preferred option with in callback refs and findDOMNode?

<details>
<summary>View answer</summary>

> It is preferred to use callback refs over findDOMNode() API. Because findDOMNode() prevents certain improvements in React in the future.

```js
// The legacy approach of using findDOMNode

class MyComponent extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    findDOMNode(this).scrollIntoView()
  }

  render() {
    return <div />
  }
}
```

```js
// The recommended approach is

class MyComponent extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    this.node.scrollIntoView()
  }

  render() {
    return <div ref={node => (this.node = node)} />
  }
}
```

</details>

### How to pass a parameter to an event handler or callback?

<details>
<summary>View answer</summary>

- You can use an arrow function to wrap around an event handler and pass parameters

```js
<button onClick={() => this.handleClick(id)} />
```

- This is equivalent to calling .bind as below

```js
<button onClick={this.handleClick.bind(this, id)} />
```

</details>

### What is context?

<details>
<summary>View answer</summary>

> Context is a globally available prop that should only be used on occations when you need something that is going to be everywhere in the applications, perhaps for translating text or something like that.

</details>

### What is the difference between HTML and React event handling?

<details>
<summary>View answer</summary>

1.  In HTML, the event name should be in lowercase.

```js
<button onclick="activateLasers()">
```

1.  Whereas in ReactJS it follows camelCase convention

```js
<button onClick={activateLasers}>
```

1.  In HTML, you can return false to prevent default behavior

```js
<a href="#" onclick="console.log('The link was clicked.'); return false" />
```

1.  Whereas in ReactJS you must call preventDefault explicitly

```js
function handleClick(e) {
  e.preventDefault()
  console.log('The link was clicked.')
}
```

### Why does React need a root element?

<details>
<summary>View answer</summary>

> Since React is all Javascript it needs an element where it can render out it's own DOM tree

</details>

### How does React prevent injection attacks?

<details>
<summary>View answer</summary>

> React DOM escapes any values embedded in JSX before rendering them to help prevent cross site scripting attacks.

</details>

### What is the React context?

<details>
<summary>View answer</summary>

> It's an experimental API that allows you to pass data down through a tree of components without having to use props.

</details>

### What is ReactDOM?

<details>
<summary>View answer</summary>

> It's a top-level React API to render a React element into the DOM, via the ReactDOM.render method.

</details>

### What are refs in React and what are they used for?

<details>
<summary>View answer</summary>

> Refs are React's "escape hatch" mechanism for a component to reference another component outside of the typical data flow. This could be in order to correctly integrate with third party libraries, change focus on another component in the UI, triggering animations, etc.

</details>

### What would be a good lifecycle method to make a remote call to fetch data for a component?

<details>
<summary>View answer</summary>

> `componentDidMount`

</details>

### What are some limitations of things you shouldn't do in the component's render method?

<details>
<summary>View answer</summary>

> You cannot modify the component's `state` (with `setState`), nor interact with the browser (do that in `componentDidMount`). `render` should be a pure function.

</details>

### Why would you need to bind event handlers to this?

<details>
<summary>View answer</summary>

> You need to do this in order for 'this' to refer to the object instance of the React component class in your callback code, otherwise 'this' will be undefined. An alternative is to use arrow functions in your event handlers and 'this' will be initialized as expected.

</details>

### How would you prevent a component from rendering in React?

<details>
<summary>View answer</summary>

> Return null from the `render` method.

</details>

### How would you prevent a component from rendering in React?

<details>
<summary>View answer</summary>

> It allows for more efficient rendering of lists, so that React can reuse DOM elements without having to destroy + recreate them when lists change (slightly) in the UI.
