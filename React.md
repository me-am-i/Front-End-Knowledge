### What are some limitations of things you shouldn't do in the component's render method?

<details>
<summary>View answer</summary>

> You cannot modify the component's `state` (with `setState`), nor interact with the browser (do that in `componentDidMount`). `render` should be a pure function.

### Why would you need to bind event handlers to this?

<details>
<summary>View answer</summary>

> You need to do this in order for 'this' to refer to the object instance of the React component class in your callback code, otherwise 'this' will be undefined. An alternative is to use arrow functions in your event handlers and 'this' will be initialized as expected.
